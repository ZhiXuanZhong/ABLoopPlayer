(c) 2016 Alexander Grahn

Two video players, **ytplayer** and **vplayer**, based on HTML5, jQuery and JavaScript, with **A-B loop**, **slow motion** and **bookmarking** functionality for online video (YouTube) and local video files in the MP4/H.264, WebM or Ogg/Theora formats.

**Features:**
- The A-B loop window can be adjusted using a double-handled slider, <kbd>&larr;</kbd> & <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> on the keyboard, or, more accurately, via two time input fields.
- The entire A-B loop window can be moved pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and moving one of the slider handles.
- A-B loops can be saved as bookmarks for the current or for later sessions on the same computer and in the same browser.
- Bookmarked A-B loops can be annotated individually with short description texts.
- resizable video display

**Installation:** [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/grahna/ytplayer/archive/master.zip) and unzip the archive file. 

**Usage:** Open one of `ytplayer.html` or `vplayer.html` in the Web browser. In **ytplayer**, enter a YouTube video ID for viewing online video. **vplayer** is for viewing local video files.

Note: In Chrome, bookmarked loops cannot be annotated nor deleted, currently.
