Two video players, **ytplayer** and **vplayer**, based on HTML5, jQuery and JavaScript, with **A-B loop**, **slow motion** and **bookmarking** functionality for online video (YouTube) and local video files in the MP4/H.264, WebM or Ogg/Theora formats.

**Features:**
- A-B loop ranges can be adjusted using a double-handled slider, using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or, more accurately, via two time input fields.
- A-B loops can be saved as bookmarks for the current or for later sessions on the same computer and in the same browser, preferably Firefox, thanks to local browser cookies.
- Bookmarked A-B loops can be annotated individually with short description texts.
- resizable video display

**Usage:** Open one of `ytplayer.html` or `vplayer.html` in Firefox. In **ytplayer** enter a YouTube video ID for viewing online video. **vplayer** is for viewing local video files.

Note: In Chrome, persistent bookmarks are created only if the players are installed on a web server.
